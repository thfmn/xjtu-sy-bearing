# Full-Life Pipeline: cnn2d_simple
#
# 2D CNN on STFT spectrograms (128×128×2) with full-life normalized RUL.
# Evaluates on all 9,216 samples with normalized [0, 1] RUL targets.
# Directly comparable to published papers (e.g., Li et al. 2024).
#
# Huber delta: 10.0 / 125 = 0.08 (scaled from raw RUL to [0,1] range)
#
# Usage:
#   python scripts/05_train_dl_models.py --model cnn2d_simple \
#       --config configs/fulllife_cnn2d.yaml --tracking mlflow
