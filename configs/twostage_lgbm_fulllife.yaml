# Full-Life Pipeline: LightGBM on extracted features (normalized RUL)
#
# Same LightGBM hyperparameters as twostage_lgbm.yaml, but evaluates on ALL
# samples with RUL normalized to [0, 1] per bearing (first file = 1.0, last = 0.0).
# This produces metrics directly comparable to published papers (e.g., Jin et al. 2025).
#
# Usage:
#   python scripts/10_train_lgbm.py --config configs/twostage_lgbm_fulllife.yaml
