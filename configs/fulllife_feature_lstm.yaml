# Full-Life Pipeline: Feature Sequence LSTM
#
# BiLSTM on sliding windows of 65 extracted features with full-life
# normalized RUL. Evaluates on all 9,216 samples with [0, 1] targets.
# Same architecture as twostage_feature_lstm.yaml — only the evaluation
# protocol and Huber delta differ.
#
# Huber delta: 10.0 / 125 = 0.08 (scaled from raw RUL to [0,1] range)
#
# Usage:
#   python scripts/11_train_feature_lstm.py --config configs/fulllife_feature_lstm.yaml
