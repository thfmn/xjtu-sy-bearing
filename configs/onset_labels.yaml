# ONSET-8: Manual Onset Labeling Reference
#
# Manually-verified onset indices for all 15 XJTU-SY bearings.
# Used for training and evaluating two-stage RUL prediction models.
#
# Labeling Methodology:
# 1. Primary indicator: kurtosis (sensitive to impulsive defects)
# 2. Secondary indicator: RMS (sensitive to gradual wear)
# 3. Onset criterion: First sustained increase (>2σ above baseline for >5 consecutive samples)
#    OR first RMS increase that doesn't return to baseline
# 4. Baseline: First 20% of bearing life (healthy period)
# 5. Upgrade criteria: SNR > 100 AND 100% post-onset above threshold = high confidence
#
# Confidence levels:
#   high: Clear onset point with high SNR (>100), 100% sustained post-onset, or strong exceedance (>5σ)
#   medium: Onset point visible but with moderate exceedance (2-5σ) or noisy baseline
#   low: Ambiguous onset, multiple possible interpretations, or large onset range
#
# Fields:
#   bearing_id: Unique identifier (e.g., Bearing1_1)
#   condition: Operating condition (35Hz12kN, 37.5Hz11kN, 40Hz10kN)
#   onset_file_idx: File index where degradation begins (0-indexed)
#   confidence: Labeling confidence (high/medium/low)
#   detection_method: Which health indicator was used (kurtosis/rms/composite)
#   onset_range: [min_idx, max_idx] for ambiguous cases (optional)
#   notes: Additional observations
#
# Total: 15 bearings
# High confidence: 11 bearings
# Medium confidence: 2 bearings
# Low confidence: 2 bearings

  # ============================================================
  # Condition 2: 37.5Hz / 11kN (5 bearings)
  # ============================================================

  - bearing_id: Bearing2_1
    condition: 37.5Hz11kN
    onset_file_idx: 452
    confidence: high
    detection_method: kurtosis
    notes: >
      Very long healthy life (452/491 files healthy = 92%). Stable baseline
      (0.02±0.04), clear kurtosis spike at 452. High confidence - classic
      sudden onset near end of life.

  - bearing_id: Bearing2_2
    condition: 37.5Hz11kN
    onset_file_idx: 47
    confidence: high
    detection_method: kurtosis
    notes: >
      Stable baseline (0.03±0.03), clear onset at file 47. Kurtosis rises
      to 2.28 at failure. High confidence early-life defect initiation.

  - bearing_id: Bearing2_3
    condition: 37.5Hz11kN
    onset_file_idx: 122
    confidence: high
    detection_method: kurtosis
    notes: >
      Long life (533 files). Stable baseline (0.02±0.03), sustained kurtosis
      increase starting at file 122. Clear degradation pattern. High confidence.

  - bearing_id: Bearing2_4
    condition: 37.5Hz11kN
    onset_file_idx: 9
    confidence: low
    detection_method: rms
    onset_range: [7, 15]
    notes: >
      Very short life (42 files), unstable baseline. Kurtosis shows high
      initial values (0.87-1.79 in first 10 samples) then DECREASES during
      failure. RMS shows onset around file 9. Unusual failure pattern -
      possibly pre-existing defect or anomalous bearing. Low confidence.

  - bearing_id: Bearing2_5
    condition: 37.5Hz11kN
    onset_file_idx: 121
    confidence: high
    detection_method: rms
    notes: >
      Long life (339 files). Kurtosis never exceeds baseline threshold and
      actually DECREASES toward failure (-0.51). RMS shows clear onset at
      file 121 with SNR=132.3 and 100% post-onset sustained above threshold.
      Progressive wear failure mode, not impulsive. Upgraded from medium.

  # ============================================================
  # Condition 3: 40Hz / 10kN (5 bearings)
  # ============================================================

  - bearing_id: Bearing3_1
    condition: 40Hz10kN
    onset_file_idx: 748
    confidence: high
    detection_method: composite
    onset_range: [748, 870]
    notes: >
      Very long life (2538 files). Stable baseline (0.03±0.03). Kurtosis-based
      detection at 870, but composite HI shows earlier change at 748.
      Multiple degradation stages visible. High confidence on 748.

  - bearing_id: Bearing3_2
    condition: 40Hz10kN
    onset_file_idx: 169
    confidence: low
    detection_method: rms
    onset_range: [169, 1441]
    notes: >
      Very long life (2496 files). High initial kurtosis baseline (1.84±0.30).
      Kurtosis never shows clear onset - actually decreases toward failure.
      RMS shows gradual increase starting around file 169 (2σ) but more
      definitive change at 1233-1441 (2.5-3σ). Very gradual degradation.
      Low confidence - onset range spans large portion of life.

  - bearing_id: Bearing3_3
    condition: 40Hz10kN
    onset_file_idx: 339
    confidence: high
    detection_method: kurtosis
    notes: >
      Clear stable baseline (0.05±0.03), sharp kurtosis increase at file 339.
      Well-defined onset point with sustained degradation. High confidence.

  - bearing_id: Bearing3_4
    condition: 40Hz10kN
    onset_file_idx: 1417
    confidence: medium
    detection_method: rms
    onset_range: [1012, 1417]
    notes: >
      Very long life (1515 files). Initial high kurtosis (1.66 at file 0)
      causes composite to show very early "onset" at file 3, which is
      misleading. RMS shows sustained increase only at file 1417 (2.5σ) with
      100% post-onset above threshold. Earlier RMS change at 1012 (2σ) shows
      only 10.8% sustained. Used conservative 1417 as onset. SNR=320.8.

  - bearing_id: Bearing3_5
    condition: 40Hz10kN
    onset_file_idx: 29
    confidence: medium
    detection_method: rms
    onset_range: [24, 71]
    notes: >
      Short-medium life (114 files). High baseline variance (0.16) results in
      low SNR=6.1. RMS increases from file 24-29 onwards (2σ). 95.6% post-onset
      sustained but high baseline noise prevents high confidence. Progressive
      wear failure mode.

# Summary Statistics:
# - Bearings with kurtosis-based onset: 7 (1_2, 1_3, 1_4, 2_1, 2_2, 2_3, 3_3)
# - Bearings with RMS-based onset: 6 (1_1, 1_5, 2_4, 2_5, 3_2, 3_4, 3_5)
# - Bearings with composite-based onset: 2 (3_1)
#
# Key observations:
# 1. Kurtosis works well for sudden/impulsive defect initiation (cage failure, spalling)
# 2. RMS is more reliable for progressive wear patterns (lubrication degradation)
# 3. Some bearings show decreasing kurtosis during failure (Bearing2_4, 2_5, 3_2)
#    indicating smoothing of defect surfaces or distributed damage
# 4. Very long-lived bearings (2500+ files) often show multiple degradation stages
# 5. High SNR (>100) with 100% post-onset sustained = reliable high confidence label
