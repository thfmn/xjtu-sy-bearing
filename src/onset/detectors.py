"""Onset detection algorithms for bearing degradation.

This module provides multiple algorithms for detecting the onset of degradation
in bearing health indicator time series. Detection is the first stage in a
two-stage RUL prediction pipeline.

Algorithms:
- ThresholdOnsetDetector: Simple threshold-based detection (mean + k*sigma)
- CUSUMOnsetDetector: Cumulative Sum change-point detection (planned)
- BayesianOnsetDetector: Bayesian Online Change-Point Detection (planned)
- EnsembleOnsetDetector: Combine multiple detectors with voting (planned)

Reference:
- Threshold/CUSUM: Standard Statistical Process Control methods
- Bayesian: Adams & MacKay (2007), "Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection"
